Robomaster Plate Detection

Facilitate Auto-aim for target shooting by real-time tracking of enemy robotsâ€™ armor plates.

An object detection model is used to detect the armor plates on the robots inorder to attack the enemy robots.

1. Purely using CV techniques - Blur, HSV conversion and filtering of Blue color, Removal of noise, Find contours. Resulted in lots of false positives
2. Using Yolo - state-of-the-art object detection model with a very smal inference runtime. Used pretrained model to perform detection. Outputs: Nearest plate detected with confidence score and angle offsets from the center of the bounding boxes.
